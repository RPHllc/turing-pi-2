## Mounting Swap
If you're building containers or working with large models, it's advisable to mount SWAP (typically correlated with the amount of memory in the board). Run these commands to disable ZRAM and create a swap file:

sudo systemctl disable nvzramconfig
sudo fallocate -l 16G /mnt/16GB.swap
sudo mkswap /mnt/16GB.swap
sudo swapon /mnt/16GB.swap

Then add the following line to the end of /etc/fstab to make the change persistent:
/mnt/16GB.swap  none  swap  sw 0  0

## Disabling the Desktop GUI
If you're running low on memory, you may want to try disabling the Ubuntu desktop GUI. This will free up extra memory that the window manager and desktop uses (around ~800MB for Unity/GNOME or ~250MB for LXDE)

You can disable the desktop temporarily, run commands in the console, and then re-start the desktop when desired:

$ sudo init 3     # stop the desktop
# log your user back into the console (Ctrl+Alt+F1, F2, ect)
$ sudo init 5     # restart the desktop
If you wish to make this persistent across reboots, you can use the follow commands to change the boot-up behavior:

$ sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target     # disable desktop on boot
$ sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target      # enable desktop on boot
