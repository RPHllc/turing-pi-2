# turing-pi-2

### Start learning about the board here https://docs.turingpi.com/docs

### First step to bring board to current firmware
#### Download the .img file from https://firmware.turingpi.com/turing-pi2/
#### Burn the image onto the SD card, follow steps from https://docs.turingpi.com/docs/turing-pi2-bmc-v1x-to-v2x

### WE NEED TO DECIDE IF WE WILL LEAVE THE SD CARD INSTALLED
#### What would be the use cases? 

### Second step is to define the node settings https://docs.turingpi.com/docs/turing-pi2-automating-node-and-usb-settings
#### As the mini PCI-Express will be used, we need to set the USB HOST MODE to Node 3 (before turning the Nodes ON)
#### The nodes start in "off" state, the automation can turn them on automatically after power up
