## ssh-convenience

When playing with the CM4 boards and K3S you will see yourself typing ssh username@url several times. You will also get confused with names and node names, but you can improve your odds...

### Find or create a SSH key on your computer

Logged as a user in your Mac, `cd ~/.ssh && ls`

If the directory does not exist, `mkdir ~/.ssh`.

If you do not have a file called id_rsa.pub
